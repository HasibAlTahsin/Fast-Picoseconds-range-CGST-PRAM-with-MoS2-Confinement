# Fast-Picoseconds-range-CGST-PRAM-with-MoS2-Confinement
Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PRAM) stands out among emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies due to its ability to toggle between distinct amorphous and crystalline phases under thermal control. This study presents an extensively simulated and analytically evaluated PRAM device model, incorporating a carbon-doped Ge₂Sb₂Te₅ (C-GST) phase-change layer, a monolayer MoS₂ thermal barrier, and TiN-based nano-heating. Leveraging multiphysics modeling via COMSOL and predictive learning systems, we extract and validate transient switching dynamics, energy dissipation, thermal budgets, and structural integrity. The device outperforms prior literature with RESET and SET transitions at 0.98 ns and 0.7 ns respectively, a thermal confinement boost of >30%, and energy savings over 40%. All equations, variables, and parameters are derived from physical simulation and image-based data in the original source figures. This section introduces the physics, rationale, and materials strategy driving the fastest and most efficient PRAM configurations ever modeled.
